Okay, here we go! This is the 'First' Python program.
Why am I writing this? specific reason: I need to master DSA to crack the coding interviews.
Trying to be professional but also keep it real—I'm aiming for a job at Google in 4 months.
Code is poetry, but sometimes it's just printing stuff to make sure the interpreter isn't mad at me.
Let's grind!

The main block: The entry point of my destiny.
This is where Python starts executing my master plan.

# Just in case the universe blinked, here's a reminder.
